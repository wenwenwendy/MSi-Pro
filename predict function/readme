#usege for predict function
Input below commond in the terminal:
eg:
python predictiontest_tobepacked.py /lustre/wmy/Project/data/data_MSi/data_evaluate/DFCI-5283-9.xlsx A0101_9.1.h5 A0201_9.1.h5 /lustre/wmy/Project/data/from_Prof.Sun/9mer_k=99/models/

/lustre/wmy/Project/data/data_MSi/data_evaluate/DFCI-5283-9.xlsx is the peptide data to be predicted.(by defaut it is data that is binders called by immunoprecipitated with W6/32 antibody)
A0101_9.1.h5 A0201_9.1.h5 is the alleles to be set as model weight one by one
/lustre/wmy/Project/data/from_Prof.Sun/9mer_k=99/models/ is the path that restores the modelweights that have been trained before

#usege for predict function
Input below commond in the terminal:
eg:


python predictiontest_tobepacked.py --binder_xlsx=/lustre/wmy/Project/data/data_MSi/data_evaluate/DFCI-5283-9.xlsx 
--alleletxt=list_of_alleles.txt 
--modelweight_dir=/lustre/wmy/Project/data/from_Prof.Sun/9mer_k=99/models/ 
--savedir=/lustre/wmy/Project/Project-Pan_Allele/predict_function/

#/binder_xlsx is the peptide data to be predicted.(by defaut it is data that is binders called by immunoprecipitated with W6/32 antibody)
#alleletxt is the alleles to be set as model weight one by one
#modelweight_dir is the path that restores the modelweights that have been trained before
#savedir is the custom path to which users can save the prediction results as csv format
